    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Virtual Super Market</strong> is a Unity-based mobile simulation game that allows players to run their own supermarket business. The game focuses on entrepreneurship and management, enabling players to buy products from suppliers, set prices, serve customers, and strategically expand their store.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Players begin with a small shop and limited inventory. They must manage stock, track sales, and optimize profits. As the game progresses, players can unlock new product lines, upgrade shelves, improve the store layout, and attract more customers. The game features realistic customer behavior, dynamic pricing, and incremental growth mechanics for an engaging and educational experience.
